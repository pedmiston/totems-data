12/11/2017 14:49:46,830,We had to make combinations between resources that were given us in order to make tools to then create logs we we could end up making totem poles. ,"No, I understood what I was supposed to do.",1,2,7,"I tried every combination I could think of when trying to make tools. I then tried combining two of the same resources and after a while, I started to think realistically about making the tools and trying to see if there were any patterns but this was very hard to do. ","This game was so frustrating. For my first three sessions, I was not able to get barely any of the tools and I was getting super frustrated with how a person could even make a totem pole. "

12/11/2017 14:57:54,831,I was to imagine being a part of a tribe that must build a totem pole to please their gods. To do this I must take advantage of the resources around me and combine them in novel ways to develop new tools and technology for crafting the best possible totem pole.,"No, I understood what I was supposed to do.",2,4,6,I suppose the closest thing I had to a strategy was combining as many items as possible in the beginning. Following that I focused more on putting resources together in the way I thought they could produce something greater.,"My biggest issue was the temperature of the room and lack of circulation, it made it incredibly difficult to stay alert and mentally efficient."

12/12/2017 12:57:56,833,"I was asked to complete an experiment which I had to create a totem pole to gain points. The totem pole had to be created by resources I already had, through different combinations. ","Yes, I was confused about the task.",2,1,7,"At first, I just copied what the ancestors had already done. This gave me an additional pool of tools to choose from when working in the workshop. However, beyond that, it i couldn't find combinations that would work for anything else. I would combine things that I  thought would make sense, such as two logs or a rock and a log for carving, and nothing would work. Whatever strategy I had did not work as I couldn't make any tools on my own. ",Just curious if this was even possible to make a totem pole.

9/14/2018 15:12:28,846,"At first I was pretty confused with how to create certain things, however 10 minutes in I noticed that I could just click the record button and it would tell me how to create everything. So even though I would of finished much faster with better instructions, I would not have improved my score. I was told in the beginning to stack some logs on top of each other to make a little statue thing and that's it.","No, I understood what I was supposed to do.",1,7,1,Not really I just looked at the record link and produced every material because it got me points and then I noticed that the different color assortments that I used would give me more points so I did that too.,I truly believe I mastered this game.
