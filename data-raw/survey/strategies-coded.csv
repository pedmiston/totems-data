ID_Player,Sydny,Strategy
17,causal/random,I tried combining resources that seemed to make sense together but when that didn't work I resorted to trying the resources in random combinations to try to get a fit.
18,causal/random,Try to use realistic combinations instead of just randomly combining the resources.
19,systematic/random,"I tried to take a systematic approach at first, but eventually I just started combining things at random hoping they would combine into something useful."
22,random/systematic,random and pairing one by one to make combinations.
21,systematic ,Yes I tried to systematically combine two resource pairs
20,causal ,use rocks to create tools first and then use developed tools for further advanced tools.
27,systematic ,"Trial and Error, process of elimination"
26,no,No
28,systematic,"Once I got new materials, I tried to combine those new materials together"
25,no,NA
31,random ,just randomly kept putting things together
32,causal,Most of the time I tried to come up with a realistic way to create certain tools as if this were real life
29,systematic,I try to make a combination of every possible thing... but it doesn't work well
30,systematic,I placed each resource in the space by itself and tried pairing it with every other resource available. I also tried pairing the resources with the tools that were created.
34,systematic,"I put all of the same together first, than I switched one out each time it didn't work"
33,systematic,I would pick one thing and match everything up to it and see if it paired. then i would pick the next object.
36,no,there's a strategy?
35,random,"No, just try different combinitions."
39,ancestor ,I just used the help from the ancestor. With her directions on how to create certain tools.
38,systematic,"I attempted to take as much of a patterned approach as possible, in order to not skip any possibility."
40,systematic,"yes, some math strategy, since they are so many possibilities, I want to give up."
37,systematic,pick a resource and combine it with one another among the rest of resources and try one by one.
44,systematic,I tried to use one to the max combinations then went from there.
42,no,I tried to but it didn't work.
43,causal/random,At first I used basic knowledge and assumption to create combinations. Toward the end I got frustrated and picked combinations at random
41,systematic/causal,"Started with simple trial and error, then used my intuition to build better tools."
45,systematic,"I tried to combine each object with itself and all the other objects at least once and then vary those objects I'm combining with other objects. I tried to just try the patterns of combining everything together. (i.e Wood + wood, wood + rock, wood + rock + berry, etc)"
46,systematic/random,"In the beginning, I thought to put different things together. Soon after I just felt the need to put in different things and randomize them."
47,systematic,tried out each resources with the other resources
50,systematic,try to find all tools the derive from solely resources and then keep trying combinations
48,causal/random,I tried combining items that I thought would work together but it did not work well.
49,systematic/random,"At first, I make combinations of two using the original resources. After awhile, the combinations were mostly random."
53,no,no
52,systematic,trying all combinations
51,causal,Part of it was common sense.
54,systematic,I guess I sort of just used trial and error.
55,ancestor ,Try to think about the ancestor tools how to build
56,systematic,"you started simple, and then using the tools you built with simple resources to make complex resources"
57,systematic,I tried using different combinations
58,causal/systematic,I tried to try different tools one by one. I tried to think what tools would make sense if you put them together.
61,ancestor ,I used the resources that my ancestor had and built up from there
60,random/ancestor,Trying random combinations and looking at how previous tools were made.
59,no,"Not really, I just put pieces together that looked like they could make something new"
62,no,Not really. I just grouped random supplies together with others until they made a new supply.
63,systematic,"I guessed and checked nearly everything, based off of what was used previously to get other resources."
66,systematic,systematically increasing items in workshop
64,systematic,"Try items alone, try same item together"
65,systematic,"Try to combine the tools together, including the basic tools and advanced tools."
69,causal,just tried to think of what would actually build things in real life
70,ancestor ,knowledge of tools of the past
71,systematic,I tried used different things and kept track of what I did before and didn't do it again to not waste my time.
72,systematic,rotating out multiple items if i had excess than two
73,systematic,probability of combinations of items
74,no,"No, just used trial and error. I also observed what the other player was doing and basically copied when  he managed to create a new tool."
76,no,No
78,systematic,"After figuring out what the idea of the game was, I had a better sense of what to do."
79,no,No. I just put the materials randomly.
9075607284,systematic,"Most of the tools need to combine two materials, and some of them are identical materials."
75,no,no
81,systematic,I combine items in order so I can try all the possible combinations.
85,systematic,"at first, combine each of the resources together"
83,systematic,I tried to keep organized and remember which combinations I have tried and which seem to make sense.
84,systematic,At times I would pick in a pattern to try not repeat
86,causal?,"yes, like rock and wood can basically make some good stuff"
88,causal,based on my common sense
89,systematic,Lots of trial and error. Tried to look for patterns in ways tools were formed.
90,systematic,"At first I tried making something out of each individual item, but that only created one new tool. Then I started to combine two items together, but again that only created one new tool. At that point, I tried many new combinations with 3-4 resources. I wasn't able to create anything else and that was extremely frustrating."
92,systematic,"I tried to methodically test all unique possibilities, although i didn't include combos with multiples of the same resource initially, which made me miss some."
93,no,No
91,systematic,Combining the resources in different orders
95,causal,I tried to use logic. So I knew I would somehow have to cut the tree down into logs and I the only resources offered that could have been made into something sharp were the rocks so that's why I decided to workshop the two together.
96,systematic,"I tired, to just combine two items at a time and rotate with the items that I had. If I got a new item I tried it with original resources and well as other discovered resources."
97,systematic,I started by putting one resource and then trying every other resource with it. I would then put in the next resource and repeat. I also made sure to try and use the same object twice to see if it would produce anything.
98,ancestor ,"I created everything my ""ancestor"" created and then tried to figure out which tools were suitable in creating the tools I would need to take the next step."
99,causal,"I tried to logically think of what fit together, but also tested things that may have been unexpected, so I mostly did random guesses."
101,causal?,My specific strategy was combing the woods with the stones to try to create something stronger.
100,causal,I tried every combination that made logical sense to produce an item I thought would be helpful (e.j. the axe)
102,systematic,Brute force pattern combinations
103,systematic,"First I experimented with the initial resources by themselves to see if they gave me any new resources to work with. Then if it did, I would make more of it to then combine with other resources to create new ones."
106,ancestor ,Used the ancestors tools.
104,no,No
105,systematic,"At first I tried to combine two of everything and then moved on to three of everything. It was mostly trail and error, however I thought of what could make a sharp tool and how that eventually could lead to be able to cut a tree so I tried combinations that way."
107,causal,common sense. like breaking down a rock to make an arrowhead
108,causal,I tried to think of what i would need to build a totem
111,systematic,using math combinations.
110,systematic,"Whenever we created new resources, we tried to put them together in order to create more tools."
109,no,"No not really, just combined random things.  However, I did try to make everything my ancestors had made."
113,no,"No, it was just kind of randomized."
114,no,No
112,systematic,"Based off of previous tools I made, I would try combinations with the materials previously used"
116,scausal,I would try to think of it in real life. What materials make up certain tools?
115,systematic,"Yes, I stuck with one item and tried every possible other item with it to see if it generated a new item. And if it did, I tried to find logical combinations for the new item."
117,systematic,I looked for a pattern in what worked and what didn't work and tried to work off of that.
118,ancestor ,I used the ancestors items and descriptions. Also tried my best to use logical combinations that I thought made sense.
119,systematic,I just saw that two of the same objects often changed to another
121,systematic,"I tried to try all the possible combinations possible, but there were a lot of variables present."
120,systematic,I tried to combining all items with one object first so I could figure out what went together
124,systematic,I tried to start by testing every possible combination and used a pattern to test one resource up against the other. I then cross-referenced with my ancestor and built everything that they had created so that I would have it available to me.
125,systematic,"I went through each resource and pair it with itself, once and multiple times and then paired it with all the other resources, one or more, and simply put the resource in the workshop alone. Once I got some tools I repeated the process this time including the new items"
126,systematic,I just tried to combine one resource with all of the other resources to hopefully make a new resource.
129,ancestor ,Follow what the ancestor did as it slowly showed more of their work.
128,causal,"I tried to use logic to find what resources would go together, and when that didn't work I tried as many combinations as possible"
130,no,no
132,systematic,process of elimination
137,systematic,I always tried a newly discovered material by itself before trying to combine it with something else
135,random,I made random combinations or swapped one resource at a time to systematically rule out combinations.
136,systematic,combine the resource in order to try so will not skip
139,systematic,"Trying all permutations, seeing what categories of tools were possible."
140,no,No I didn't. I have no clue how to do this.
147,causal,Not exactly specific strategy. I used the wood and stone resources more because I figured those would produce tools in which I would be able to create a totem pole out of the given tree resource.
148,systematic,I just tried to make as many combinations as possible as well as use my knowledge of what an actual totem pole is supposed to look like.
149,causal/random,"When I couldn't think of any more logical combinations, I just started seeing if random things would produce something."
150,no,No
151,ancestor(partner),I looked at what my partner did
153,systematic,"I really just started off by combining the raw resources given to see what would create a tool. Then, I began attempting to combine tools with raw resources as well as with other tools."
152,ancestor,I looked at how other tools were made and took into account how many resources were used to see if there was any pattern.
154,systematic,I tried to recognize patterns that were successful in creating a material
155,systematic,First I tried to create as many combinations of the natural resources as possible. Then I tried to create as many combinations of one natural resource and one tool as possible. Then I tried to create as many combinations two tools as possible. Then I randomly tried 3 and 4 piece combinations.
159,systematic,"I just doubled up each resource, then tripled up, and sometimes quadrupled up. I also matched my new resources with old and new resources."
172,random,"no, just put random things together until they made something"
167,no,Not really I randomly put things together
173,ancestor,I started with the information from the ancestors and used their highest level of things and used it with the other tools I had. I tried to do it in a methodical way to try all types of combinations.
175,systematic,Once I made a new tool I kept this in my materials and tried using it with the other materials I already had to create new tools.
174,systematic,"At first, I didn't really have a strategy. But I decided to use one particular resource with all the items to see any matches and also try to duplicate a said item."
176,systematic,I tried to use what worked before with other materials
177,systematic,"At first, I was trying to see what resources go together and what resources, if combined, has the possibility of creating something new."
178,no,No
179,systematic,I tried to use all of the resources in different combinations.
180,systematic,"I would combine one item with all of the items in the inventory, and then repeat the process with each item."
181,causal,Used my real world knowledge to guess how to build the next tools
182,systematic,"I tried to find a pattern to the way in which the materials needed to be combined, however, the game ended before a pattern was made clear."
183,causal,"tried to think what would work well together, and randomly tried resources together"
184,causal,"I used basic logic in making some of the tools. For example, a stone, rope, and stick were used to build an ax."
185,systematic,In the beginning I tried to put one resource in the first space then add the remaining to the second space until I made a tool.
186,systematic,Trial and error based off the tools the other person had made and those I found.
187,systematic,I just tried to combine as many things as possible and hoped that they would work out
188,random,not really i just guessed and put random things in the workshop
189,causal,"I tried to think of what I would make out of the stuff that was there, but those combinations didn't work so I ended up just randomly combining all the resources and tools I had made until they made something new."
190,systematic,I tried to pair each tool with another until a new tool appeared
191,causal,"At first I tried going through each group and seeing how combos would work together. However, after being told it doesn't work for 30 minutes I ultimately gave up and did random stuff near the end."
192,systematic,"I would try each resource with every other resource until I found a combination that worked, and so on with each resource and tool."
193,systematic,just try every possible combination one by one...
194,ancestor,"First, I went with what my Ancestor knew and from there worked on how to combine more resources using more or less common sense: such as using the berries for paint"
195,causal,"I tried to think logically about what things would make something together, but then I just started randomly putting them together to see what happened."
196,systematic,"I would have one resource in the box and then match it with each other resource one at a time in order to try to make a tool. As the game went on, I tried to use tools I already made to make more tools, but then I realized that wasn't working so I just started randomly putting resources in the boxes."
197,ancestor,looking at the ancestor's tools
198,systematic,"Not in the beginning, towards the end I just desperately tried every combination I could think of + items by themselves or in duo"
200,ancestor,"First I used the ancestors to help me get quick combos, then I tried them by themselves, as a pair, and then with each item."
203,systematic,I tried to do two of each and then match one item with all the others.
205,ancestor,Used my teammate for help
204,systematic,I assumed the tools built off of each other so I would try every resource one by one until a combination worked out.
206,systematic,I tried many different combinations
207,systematic,Tried combining every resource with everything else to see if anything worked
208,systematic,I combined resources in which I thought would work together in order to develop a product that was like the ones I combined
209,no,Nothing specific
210,ancestor,I used what the ancestor used to start.
211,random,Just random order
212,systematic,"I began to combine as many objects as I could, then decided to combine the same object. I then began to use the tools that I had created to combine them with objects or other tools to hopefully create other tools."
213,ancestor,I tried to see what ways the ancestor got his/her tools and started replicating that but with different objects.
214,no,no
215,ancestor,I followed what the ancestor did.
216,random,"If I had more time, I would have eventually figured out some kind of strategy"
219,systematic,I tried to remember what combinations I already tried so I wouldn't waste time. Also checking what player 2 came up with.
218,systematic,"Once I created a new tool, I tried it with all of the other tools that I had to see if it would create any new combinations."
217,systematic,"At most, I tried to combine two different resources and see what happens. I sometimes try combining three or more resources."
221,systematic,I tried remembering every pattern that I did so I wouldn't do the wrong one twice. I also looked at what my partner had completed.
220,random,I was not able to find a successful strategy beyond guess and check.
222,ancestor,See what the ancestors have built
223,causal,"common sense, survival strategy."
224,causal,I tried to create tools that would allow me to chop down the big tree by refining stone and making materials to help like rope.
227,ancestor,No. I actually lacked in contributing as my partner did most the work.
228,causal,"I knew that we would have to make some sort of device to chop the tree down to get wood for the totem pole, so I tried to use logic to work it out."
232,systematic,trial and error
234,no,NA
233,systematic,"You can try patterns of different combinations, 1 with 1, 1 with 2 etc.  That strategy worked until a certain point."
231,no,no. just randomly put them together.
235,random,"Not really, I did not really understand how to do it so I guessed a lot."
236,ancestor,follow the ancestor
239,systematic,"When I made a new tool, I tried using it in combination with the resources given."
238,systematic,some i made the same tool and combined them and they made another tool other you put together and they cut down trees and such
237,systematic,Try using the same resource twice to create a new one and constant checking in on my partners resource box
240,causal,"Tried to think realistically, what combinations could have worked in real life (i.e. combining the bone tool and berries to mash up the berries and create a color)"
243,random,keep trying
245,random,"No, I kind of just did random combinations when I was trying myself. Otherwise, I would just look and see what other people had done."
242,no,NA
244,causal,I supposed that there may be some ways that related to the reality and use common sense can help us
246,random,There was no specific strategy just attempted a lot of combos.
9077487701,systematic,I just use different resource and new tools I just made to find if I can a new item for the totem.
248,systematic,Like the permutation in Maths
249,causal,I tried to look if there was a pattern or if there were reasonable resources that would go together to make something but it was very hard.
251,causal,"I attempted to use one object and combine it with each thing possible. But, it was hard to keep track of what I tried and what I did not try so I ended up trying to guess."
250,systematic,I tested all the combinations I could think of and made all the objects I could then started combining them to make more objects.
254,no,NA
253,no,NA
252,random,I just clicked on items that looked like they would go together.
9077409473,no,NA
256,systematic,Once I made a specific tool that involved many combinations I would make two of them so I would be prepared
257,systematic,Combining higher class stocks with the newly created stock usually end up with another new stock. Basic knowledge needed.
258,systematic,At the beginning i used guess and check a lot... I also looked at what other players were doing. By the end of the game i was thinking logically about how to form materials
262,systematic,"I just tried to combine everything in order, starting with the top right item, and working my way down from there."
259,systematic,trial and error
261,systematic,"At first trying any combo, then I used logic to figure things out"
260,no,Not really
263,causal,"At first I just randomly combined them or thought logically about what tools would be used to build other tools, but when I got stuck I systematically went through every  combination of two, and then got partially done with every combination of three."
264,systematic,"I tried every single combination of resources and tools, including trying to use two tools at once and one resource to try and build something new."
265,systematic,I tried to systematically try all the combinations of resources and tools together but it didn't work out too well.
266,systematic,I just tried to do every possible combination I could think of.
268,systematic,I tried various combinations that I could think of and sometimes would see what happened combining the same resource.
267,systematic,I was honestly just plugging things in.
272,ancestor,i looked at the ancestor chart and went from there
271,ancestor,I just looked at how the ancestor made his tools but I was only able to make three tools based off of that.
270,no,No
269,random,No I did it randomly.
274,causal,I tried to think of combinations that might make sense in the real world and used those. I also attempted to make duplicates of the same resource or tool.
276,causal,"I just tried thinking of things that would normally go together to create things, like  thin straws of wood to make a rope. I just pretty much thought about all the things that are created in the world today and was trying to figure out how I could recreate them using the resources I had at hand."
273,random,"I started out pretty much just randomly putting resources in, but toward the end I was canceling certain combinations out."
275,causal,I tried to think about real-world uses for each item in order to help me form associations between them. This technique was not very reliable.
277,ancestor,creep on the other player and see how they figure out
280,ancestor,I used the ancestor instructions to make the tools.
278,causal,"First I tried to find some logical combination of things. But after I found it so difficult, I just make math combinations."
279,causal,I thought about what I needed and what combos would most likely get me the resources I did need.
284,no,NA
281,no,No
282,ancestor,I looked at how other players were building their resources.
283,no,no
286,no,NA
287,systematic,The only strategy I used was to try and hit every possible combination of items together.
285,systematic,Fix one item and try the other one
288,ancestor,"No, I just checked other players methods."
290,no,No.
289,systematic,"I make sure that I paired up each of the resources at least once, just to know if it will work or not."
292,systematic,"At first, I was trying all the different combinations and monitoring my teammates and their progress. Once they discovered a new resource, I was able to look up the combination myself and create the object."
291,systematic,I used trial and error until I had a better understanding of how the game worked then I used strategy to try and create different tools from the resources given. I also looked at what resources the other players had made to give me some direction as to what different combinations of resources and tools worked together.
294,no,"No, I just go with my instincts"
296,systematic,trial and error
293,ancestor,Yes I was using what the other participants were figuring out what they were doing and they were helping me make new things.
295,random,I just combined the resources at random. I should have come up with more of a strategy.
297,causal,"other than certain logic, certain combinations were quite vague"
298,no,No
299,ancestor,I used the ancestors achievements to create tools.
301,systematic,I tried to combine each item with each other and go through each pair
302,no,Not really
303,systematic,I tried to combine every item with each other and then with new items
304,systematic,"I tried out a combination on every item, I also kept track of other people's points because I could see how they got them and match their points."
305,random,Making random combonations
306,ancestor,I just copied what the other players did
307,systematic,I would keep one item in the workshop and then go through the items I had and put them in there.
308,systematic,i tried to arrange stuff with new tools created by me
309,systematic,I just tried different combinations by starting with one and matching it with each other resource
311,ancestor,I just did what the other players did and tried to come up with unique combinations.
312,random,"Not really, I was just trying a bunch of different combinations."
310,systematic,"The strategy that I used was to designate certain materials that I put at the bottom in the workshop, and then basically did guess and check with all the materials and tried to find which materials produced a product."
316,no,no
317,causal,try to utilize the tree and the wood as much as possible. also rock combos work
319,systematic,I just went down the list making combinations and seeing which ones worked or not.
318,random,At first I was just putting random things together to see if I got any result and once I had a few things under my belt I decided a faster approach would be good and put together things that I thought would make sense to put together but my method was inconsistent and it started to all just feel random so then I abandoned common sense and just went for as many combinations as I could.
322,causal,I used what would logically make sense in real life for example the ax and the tree gives you a certain cut of wood
323,systematic,"No, I just try everything out. And I watch what the other people do, and imitate."
321,random,"no, just randomly put things together hoping for the combinations to work."
320,causal,I thought about how the different tools would be used in a practical sense to create other resources to make the totems. I also tried to craft new tools by testing newly crafted tools with the different resources and existing tools.
325,systematic,"Not really, I tried to combine them all in different ways"
326,causal,"I tried to think logically about how things could be built. Mostly, when one of the other players figured something out, I was quick to copy them."
324,ancestor,"At first I had absolutely no idea what I was doing and didn't know that I could look at other people's so I was very stuck.  After I saw others people's I could understand the task, but it was still hard to figure out what to put together."
327,systematic,"Often you had to combine two of the same material or ""break"" it up."
331,systematic,Hit and trial
329,systematic,A bunch of guess and check
330,systematic,I tried any combinations that I possibly could.
328,systematic,I just did all sorts of combinations.
332,ancestor,I used the other people's combinations if I was stuck and random choice.
333,systematic,"When one resource worked, I tried combining it with all the other known resources, including itself."
335,systematic,I tried to use the new tools as parts of making even more new tools
334,systematic,use possibilities to find which more combinations
336,systematic,I use maths method to arrange them by sequence.
337,causal,I tried to pair things that in real life i thought could be used to make something else.
338,systematic,Yes. I used methods of mathematics.
339,causal,"I tried to rely on my personal understanding of natural resources and their relationships. After a while, I considered the possibility that the activity was not modeling a realistic situation, and started to try random combinations and doubling the amount of certain resources."
356,systematic,"I tried combining each tool with each starting material, creating an axe using tools and starting materials, combining multiple tools and/or multiple starting materials with one-another, and so forth."
357,causal,I had a basic logic of trying to identify the functions of the tool gained and try to make use of it.
358,systematic,I would try to see what things worked in the past to create resources and mimic those combinations in terms of number and type of resource.
360,ancestor,Copy other people and hope for the best.
359,systematic,I tried to find a pattern but was unable to identify one.
361,systematic,I would take a signle resource and try every combination for that resource. If no other combination was found I did random combinations.
363,causal,"I tried to logically think about what the different resources would be or could be used for and then tried to combine them accordingly... Like with the sharp spear thing made from rock, I assumed it would carve things so I put it with the log, and it did."
362,systematic,I tried to combine all of the original resources and then combined them with what resources I made. When I couldn't think of any more combinations I put items together in a random order to try and find more matches.
364,no,NA
376,no,Not really
377,systematic,Once I found the tools I couldnt build the totem
392,random,It was pretty random - the first time I didn't realize you were supposed to put the tools I had made into the stock but once i figured that out i was able to actually move forward (although rather slowly )
397,systematic,"Yes, I started by combining each material with itself, and then pairing it with each other object. If a combination worked, I would try to use that new material with the old material again. Other than that, I mostly tried random combinations that seemed like they could logically pair and create a new object."
400,causal,"I just thought of what would make sense to use in real life, like the ax i figured i would need some kind of branch along with a rock and something to secure that rock to the branch."
401,causal,Think about how can our ancients exploit the nature
412,random,No I randomly combined things until something worked.
413,systematic,Trying ever possible combination
414,systematic,I tried to do every combination at least once. Then I started combining materials that I made from combining others.
415,systematic,I tried to go one by one and combine one resource with each one at a time.
416,random,Just randomly combing things
419,systematic,"Usually trial and error, most combinations (up until 1250 pts) were logical."
431,no,No.
430,systematic,I tried to pair each resource with a different resource at least once to test it out.
433,causal,I tried to use logic in order to create new resources.
434,systematic,"Yes, I tried combining similar things that I found from the other items and then duplicates and so on to try to find new combinations."
435,systematic,"Once I got 1 tool, I tried combining different resources in the same way. Most of the time, I just used random resources and guessed."
449,systematic,"At first, no. Once I hit a block where I couldn't figure any combos out, I did trial and error."
450,no,No.
452,causal,I tried to combine things that would maybe go together in real life.
455,causal,I tried to put together combinations together that I would personally use if I were in that situation.
456,causal,I tried to combine resources that I thought would logically create something else
457,systematic,once you figure out a tool odds are it will create and open up many other options
458,no,no
460,systematic,Just keep trying.
464,systematic,"At first, you just try every kind of combination because you know nothing about it. After that, it would be better if you use your common sense to guess what kind of combination may work. Sometimes some previous combinations may give hint."
473,causal,I tried to make certain items like the ax.
476,random,At first I was just randomly putting items together. Towards the end I started looking at other players items and seeing how they made them. I then copied their actions in order to make the same tools. This made creating my own tools easier because they gave me ideas and a place to start.
478,systematic,I just tried any possible combination I could think of.
479,systematic,"No, just combining all different resources and different things together to try and make tools and new resources"
477,systematic,"First I just use one totem to try, then different two, then different three, four... And finally I tried using the same two tools to build."
480,no,NA
481,systematic,"At first, I tried to attempt to use a strategy but there were too many resources to create a pattern so I tired to go randomly."
482,causal,If they liked like they could make something together then I tried those combinations first
483,systematic,At first i was using a method of trying every possible combination but that was yielding very few results. Only when i discovered that you can add tools to your stock did i start to make some progress.
496,no,no
497,random,"No, mostly random but once I saw that new tools created could be used I tried to use those more."
498,systematic,Combining any combination of resources just to see if something would end up working.
499,ancestor,"I just watched my teammates, but I also tried to be strategic about the combinations I was trying to produce."
503,systematic,I tried to combine my new resource with a old resource
500,no,"Not really, but seems to be related to color, and the nature."
502,causal,"I would say that my strategy, which was largely unsuccessful, was to try combinations of objects/resources that seemed to fit in some way."
501,systematic,"Initially, I tried to combine each resource with each other resource, including those that I created myself, but eventually there were too many items, and I was trying to combine them repeatedly in the same ways to no avail."
504,?,yes
506,no,NA
505,random,I just tried a bunch of random combinations
507,systematic,tried to combine like pairs (i.e. berries w berries)
508,systematic,no I just guessed and check
520,systematic,"Trail and error, used a new ""tool"" and put it in the workshop with other items. I tried the ones that seemed the most realistic first and then tried all the other tools until I got a new one."
521,no,NA
522,no,No
523,systematic,I kept one resource in the workshop and paired it with all the other resources that I had and repeated this process with every resource and every combination of resources that worked previously.
525,no,NA
527,systematic,I kind of just tried to match every resource together and then every tool and resource and then every tool and tool
529,systematic,"I basically tried trial and error most of the time. There were a few times that the new combinations were obvious (stick,rope, and stone carving tool), but a lot of the time, I found them by dumb luck."
530,no,no
531,systematic,Yes. I tried to make different combos but it seems don't work.
532,no,I did not use any specific strategy in this game.
533,causal,"imagine the exact background, try combinations in certain rule, not randomly"
534,systematic,"Once a tool was used once, such that it was transformed into something else, I did not bother using it anymore, as it's first form was just an intermediate step. Other than that I used random combinations, as the beginning tools that were created seemed to have no logic in their making."
537,ancestor,"I was able to see how the ancestor built his totem pole which gave me the basis for how to build the different logs and tools, but I was unable to figure out how to carve or paint the totem pole. I didn't really have a strategy, I just put different combinations together to see what would work."
538,ancestor,"I first looked at all the tools made by my ancestor, then attempted to combine new tools with some of the unlimited resources, or tools together. I knew some tools had been used with certain resources, so i tried to use that to make more pairs, but wasn't successful."
539,systematic,I sometimes tried matching pairs of the same thing.
541,systematic,My only strategy was using all of the possible combinations to determine if the resources made a product.
540,no,NA
543,causal,use basic knowledge and see other people's game
542,causal,it may use some strategies in the life to combine sources.
544,systematic,guess and check
555,random,I just randomly combined different items
557,random,No i just tried to put a bunch of stuff together
558,no,No I didn't
556,causal,"I was trying to use a rock to smash/cut things like the trees, logs, or berries. It didn't work really though. I was proud that I was the first person to figure out trying to combine multiple of the same item or multiple of new items."
559,causal,I tried to imagine ways that the resources available to me would fit together. I also just copied exactly what my ancestors did before me. In the end I pretty much just started throwing as many things together as I could to come up with something.
560,systematic,Combining the new tools to all the possible resources to see if any one of them produced a new tool.
562,causal,I tried to think in real life what I would use to combine each of the resources to make.
561,causal,"rocks and wood meant making logs, other than that it was random"
563,systematic,mixing and matching
564,systematic,I tested all of the possible combinationsfor each resource
565,causal,not really just tried to put together items that made sense
566,random,It was mainly just random guessing.
568,causal,I tried to think about what i would need in real life to make something and went from there.
569,systematic,"I tried to make as many different combinations as I could.  I also tried to think how I could use the new tools logically in the real world i.e. something sharp probably cuts something.  Once I found a new tool, I would try to combine it with all of the old resources and with any other tools I had."
570,systematic,in the beginning it was easy to keep track of what you were combining and after that i didnt use a strategy
571,systematic,I tried looking at patterns after having made certain ones that worked out and tried to double them and group things together. I tried to use the tools that were used more often such as the silver stone made out of the rocks or the tree twigs.
574,ancestor,Look at how the ancestor made things and then add things to the totem pole to make the score higher
575,causal,"I tried to use logic to determine which elements may create another different, useful tool. Otherwise if I was stuck I used random combinations of tools"
576,ancestor,I often looked at players for help with building resources they already built
577,causal,I tried to think of items that one would need for survival.
578,ancestor,"It was very helpful to be able to see the process of the other players, because when I saw their score go up, I knew they had come up with combinations that I had not, and I could then use their resources to come up with more."
579,systematic,I tried multiple combinations of every material
581,ancestor,I used the ancestors tools as a guide to put my tools together
580,ancestor,"At first I used the previous players successes to catch up to where they were at, then tried to do intuitive combinations that I thought would yield results. Once those stopped working, I tried each individual item paired with one other item to try and test each possible permutation (this became less effective as I obtained more resources). I also occasionally tried using items by themselves which yielded results more often than I thought it would."
582,ancestor,yes look at how to make them in the instructions and then save them.
583,causal,Not necessarily. At first I combined what looked like might go together and when that didn't work I combined everything to see what I would get.
584,ancestor,I first looked at the ancestors tools and used the combinations they used to build the same tools. Then I started taking the resources and combing them with the tools and went down the line for which tools to choose.
585,systematic,process of elimination
587,ancestor,Only materials I made were once my ancestors had made as well.
586,systematic,"At first I was very confused, but once I began to combine a few and I saw how it worked, it was a matter of systematically combining more things to find a solution to the problem."
588,systematic,"Yea, I tried doing doubles of things, but they didn't work. I also knew that if one combo worked the other could too, just like the hammer and tree 1 and hammer and tree 2."
589,ancestor,No. I copied the ancestor.
590,random,I was just doing random things mostly and would look at the ancestors findings.
591,causal,"I didn't really use any strategies, I mostly tried to think about what would be needed and worked my way through the potential options to build these."
592,ancestor,"Using the ancestors' list of sources and how to build them was very helpful, so I used that to build the same materials."
593,causal,Used reason (didn't get me far)
595,systematic,"At first, I randomly combined resources, but then I used logic to create different pieces of wood with different types of rocks."
596,ancestor,"First I looked at what the ancestor did and went off of that, figuring that since some of the tools he made weren't used yet that they must have some usage. Then it was mostly guessing and making new combinations until I got the logs."
594,ancestor,"Initially used recipes from the ancestor, then experimented to find my own"
598,ancestor,I used all the ancestors tools and tried to use the powdered fruits to make paint because they were colorful to no avail.
604,causal,logical combinations
605,no,No I did not
606,causal,Thinking about what would make logical sense to combine
607,systematic,I used trial and error as a strategy for combining resources.
608,ancestor,"Not really, I used the ancestor guide to help me though."
609,causal,I tried to combine the logs together with the lasso to create a totem pole but that did not work.
611,no,N/A
612,causal,I tried things that would break something down or build something up
613,systematic,Once I created something I went back in forth with everything and saw if I can make more things out of it. Then I would use two of the same item to try and make something else.
610,systematic,I didn't really I just tried to make different combinations of resources and tools and started getting the hang of it.
615,systematic,"I started combining all of the new resources together. Some of the combinations made sense, like the axe and wood. I also looked at what my partner was doing a lot."
616,ancestor,"I simply just looked at the ancestor's tools and how to build them. Aside from that, I just attempted different combinations of things and nothing seemed to work."
614,systematic,"At first I was doing trail and error, just going down the columns and adding everything together. It was harder and more time consuming but then I started looking at my partner's screen and what they were figuring out. We were basically the same page but we built off of each other a lot."
617,no,NA
619,systematic,"I tried to determine all the possible combinations that could be made and then continually switched resources out.. however, i only found 2 tools so evidently this wasn't the correct way to go about this"
618,no,Not really
621,no,none
620,systematic,found out a method of creating tools
622,no,"No,maybe just try every possible combinations."
626,no,I didn't use a specific strategy
623,systematic,every time I built something correct I used that tool to build the next thing
625,systematic,I tried many combinations and also looked at other player's tools in order to boost my score.
624,causal,i attempted to use a bit of common sense when combining resources but nothing specific
627,systematic,I just used guess and check
628,no,no
630,systematic,I would try to combine the things that I made
629,random,"Kind out understood what do to with what, not a specific strategy though"
631,systematic,I tried to use the patterns i found successful to build more tools.
633,systematic,Combine multiple things
632,random,"No, it was random"
635,systematic,Combine two of the same things to start off the game.
637,systematic,i tried combining each basic one with itself first and then each other before moving on to the already made tools. It also helped that you could see what your teammates have already made.
634,ancestor,No. I looked at what other people used so that I can recreate it.
636,systematic,No I pretty much just kept trying everything. I mostly tried to make new combinations with the resources i most recently acquired.
638,systematic,I combined the tools I created using available resources to create new resources
639,causal,I tried to imagine which basic resources would combine well to form basic tools.
640,ancestor,I first looked at my ancestors progress then combined random resources
641,random,"I just combined random things, I didn't really put much thought into what they would make until after I combined them."
643,systematic,In order to figure out how to make the tools I wanted I had to back track through the tools to figure out how to combine the right resources into the right tools to make the more advanced tools.
642,causal,I often used logic from the real world in how certain resources are utilized to create tools or more refined items.  Certainly I used the assumption that the items had meaning behind them that correlate with the real world .
644,no,no
645,systematic,I mainly tried to combine 2 resources... If one thing didn't work I'd try something similar. If I were to go back I would try combining more than just 2 resources together.
646,systematic,"Not really. At first, I tried to use every item equally, but then I just got frustrated and just threw random stuff together."
647,no,No
648,systematic,Try.
651,systematic,I tried everything together at the beginning and then towards the end I started realizing what combined well and tried those resources more.
652,ancestor,"yes, copied the others"
649,ancestor,"Yes, I used my partners to see what they have created and build upon them"
650,systematic,Tried every possible combination of a particular object with other objects. Tried the same object with itself. Tried realistic combinations.
654,systematic,Go through all possible combinations to gather stock
653,no,"no, random"
655,random,"No, I just tried every single resource/tools I could and clicked ""try"" to see if anything new would pop up."
656,no,I really didn't have a strategy it was very confusing at times.
659,causal,I thought the trees and rocks would be useful for the game.
657,ancestor,I looked at the ancestor's tools and created some of the tools they used. Then i started to randomly combine those tools with other resources in order to make more tools.
658,systematic,mostly trial and error and and putting the combinations that didn't work into the stock
661,systematic,I tried to try every combination for each one starting with a pair and going up but I got frustrated and ended up trying random things.
662,systematic,I started to try to make a pattern of what resources i was putting together
660,systematic,Build on each other and try to understand what objects could be used for or combine with.
665,systematic,"Yes, I combined them in groupings and did them 1-4 times. And kept going around with each new thing I created with the told things 1-4 times and each time i did that I created something new it just took a while to figure out which stuff to combine and how many to combine."
664,random,just try different combinations and see the result.
663,systematic,I tried to use a system choosing each resource with all the other ones until one worked.
666,no,no
668,causal,"First, I logically picked items that seemed to relate to one another. Second, I attempted every possible combination starting with the top left unlimited resource."
667,causal,use simple common sense
671,ancestor,I just followed what the ancestors made.
670,no,No
669,causal,I thought about what i would have done in the scenario and tried to understand what resources meant
672,ancestor,Just copied what the ancestor did and then tried combining things that I thought would be useful
675,no,NA
674,no,NA
673,ancestor,I tried to look at the other tools and see how they were made.
676,systematic,I just tried combining everything. it seems like I had tried everything twice before a new product would pop up.
678,no,NA
679,causal,Tried to think logically but I didn't know what most of the resources or tools actually were.
677,random,I just chose randomly.
681,systematic,I tried all combinations of the given resources and then started trying different combinations using the tools I made.  I was using trial and error.
680,random,"started off just randomly putting things together, then tried to use more logic"
682,systematic,I tried going in a pattern but once you start adding together three or four materials it becomes hard to follow
683,systematic,I tried going through the combinations one by one but was unsuccessful.
685,no,NA
684,no,NA
686,causal,I just tried to think about what you would do with the specific items.
687,no,no
688,systematic,I did either random assignment or I put one resource in and tried that with all of the other resources available. I also looked as to what my partner created.
689,systematic,In the beginning I worked to systematically work through possible pairings. Ex. matching everything with the large tree to see if any combinations worked.
690,systematic,attempting to try every combination
691,ancestor,Looked at what my ancestor did
692,no,no
694,systematic,I just would put on resource in the crafting and try all the other materials I had
693,no,No
695,causal,"I tried to use common sense and figure out how to get from one resource to the next, but other than that no."
698,systematic,Eh kinda. I tried combining them with like pairs
696,systematic,"I first tried all of the resources by themselves, then I put each resource together in pairs of two. When I made a new tool,  I paired that tool with each resource. I also paired new tools together."
699,ancestor,I had no specific strategy but it was helpful to see what other players were doing to create their tools
697,systematic,"I tried to go through all of them and use different combinations. If that wasn't working, I looked to see what the other players were doing and tried to see if they got any tools that I didn't."
702,systematic,I would always go back and use old items
700,ancestor,I looked at others once they combined resources and saw what I had to mix to make the better resources
701,systematic,I tried to do every possible combination to an extent but then I got frustrated because my stockpile was too small to hold all of them.
703,systematic,I used guess and check
706,systematic,"Little of just random combinations, but I also tried to think what you could actually make with all the resources."
704,no,no
705,systematic,"I tried to combine tools of the same type (trees with trees, berries with berries). That didn't seem to work very well for me. I then tried to combine them by row and column to see if I could find the tools by making random combinations."
707,systematic,Not really I just tried to make different combinations to see if they worked
708,no,NA
714,no,Not really
713,no,Not really
715,causal,Thought about what would go together well in real life.
9077655521,random,I only did random combination and then followed similar combinations if they work.
717,systematic,Trying every available option until none left
721,no,no
719,no,no
720,no,no
718,systematic,At the beginning I tried to use the newest tool I found and put it with an original resources
722,random,"No. I tried, but I wasn't sure what to combine"
724,causal,I thought about what i would do in real life and what I would need to make paint or carve
723,systematic,I first put all the resources by itself first because the instruction said one item can form something
727,no,no
725,no,No
726,causal,I tried to think about logical combinations but after a certain time I just started randomly putting resources together to see what I could create.
