Timestamp,Imagine you are passing on the tools that you discovered to another student who has never played this game before. What would you tell them to help them perform better in the game?,Participant ID
9/17/2018 12:34:02,"Make sure that you use the rock as much as possible because it yields the most results. Strategies that worked was when creating a new tool, test that new tool with every other tool or resource because that often created something new. In the end I spent a lot of time trying to create a stump because that is how you build the totem so use the tools and work with the different trees to try and build the stumps.  The most confusing part was initially starting and trying to decide what to test first so don't hesitate, just simply go for it. ",856
9/17/2018 12:34:40,I would tell them to think carefully about the materials and re-read the directions. I would tell them to try different combinations with the sturdy materials and try to make new things out of the trees as well. I found that guessing with the berries did not work and filling out all four spaces also did not work. I found it difficult/ confusing on how to actually build the pole and what to do once I ended up with certain resources. ,854
9/17/2018 12:34:56,"To begin with, use your rocks. Rocks with rocks, rocks with those advanced rocks, advanced rocks with more advanced items and you'll get a lot of combinations. The berries, not much help. Use your rocks the most. It helps if you make doubles of items and then try combining those to make more new items. Find a pattern and stick to it.",855
9/17/2018 12:37:18,"The last item I discovered was the string, I am guessing that some combination of the string with either the wood poles or the block of larger wood will give you a block. A combination of the string with one of the types of arrowhead may give you a new tool but I doubt it as I think I tried most of them. Also I think the berries are used much later in the game as an item you can use to dye the blocks of wood to make more points from the totem pole. One last piece of advice would be to try multiple of a material to see if something is produced. An example would be to try two or three arrowheads together by them self and then adding another material or tool. When you go through a cold patch where you are not making any progress take stop clicking, take your hand off the mouse and take a deep breath. Then try to think of what real life combinations would yield objects you could use.",857
9/18/2018 12:55:36,Keep the things already made in the stock pile and don't delete them because they could help you advance into other things!,871
9/18/2018 12:56:13,"Use common sense to think of combinations, but also throw things together you might not think work. I didn't expect some of the stuff to work and it did.",870
9/18/2018 12:57:47,"Once you have created two or more tools, try combining them to create even more stronger tools. When guessing, be aware that that you can use the same tool multiple times in one combination.",872
9/18/2018 13:04:45,"Keep putting items together. I found it helpful to use new items that I uncovered to create more and more items. Go off of the items you already made. I tried many combinations of two with my existing tools, and started trying groups of three and didn't find success. I got stuck at this point. Putting same items together often creates new tools. Think about what could go together to create a new tool rather than just testing out random combinations. ",873
9/18/2018 16:43:30,"I suggest trying to follow tools all the way to their most ""useful"" form. Meaning, continue to mix the new tool until it looks like something you might actually use for your totem pole. You should try to keep track of what combinations you have already done. So far I have done nothing with the berries, so I would assume those will come into play later.",874
9/18/2018 16:45:53,Use small tools to make bigger ones,875
9/18/2018 16:49:40,"I started out super slow because I had just randomly started putting the items in the workshop box hoping to find something that worked. A little ways in, I found that it would be more logical to think about a) how the items related to each other and b) how to rotate items in the workshop box so that I could keep track of what I had tried and approach the game more methodically. If I would have had more time, I would have paid more attention to what stayed when I was able to make a tool and what resource transformed into the new resource. Either way, don't get too flustered, just take a step back and think about the end goal (building the totem pole thingy) and what kind of big picture process might need to be done to get there. Also, don't start pressing keys, clicking random buttons, or checking if the computer is a touch screen - think within the game itself. Good luck!",876
9/18/2018 16:50:15,"Guess and check is the most important part. Use common sense when making guesses. Think about the real world and what can be made from natural resources. Always have  the tools you unlock at your disposal in the stock area, and do not keep many or even any of the unlimited resources within the stock area. Do not get frustrated either, it will only be harder.  ",877
9/19/2018 11:44:48,"This game was at first very confusing to me. I did not understand the premise but thought I just should try to continue doing different combinations. I kept doing them & doing them & nothing really worked. I only got a few combinations that were somewhat decent. Still, there was no specific pattern (as though it seemed) when doing it. I never really understood the intent on what to do & didn't get how you made the totem, but I only really got three combinations. So my advice is to experiment and pick up rhythms to find a consistent schedule so you just don't keep redoing certain potential combos because that is the part that got me confused the most. ",880
9/19/2018 11:49:01,"In order to succeed in this game, you need to use logic. Some tools, such as the tool I created, was made by a rope, a stick, and a rock. These three things logically go together to make such a tool. This tool was then used to chop down a tree. Thinking logically like this will make the game much easier. Also, keep experimenting the new things you acquire with the old to create something new. A strategy that worked for me when I was stumped was to match two of the same things together. Perhaps this strategy only works in the preliminary rounds, but it worked for me. A final tip is to keep trying things CONSTANTLY. I did things I thought I did before but since i was constantly trying things, I would make something new. Keep these things in mind and build a great totem pole! Good Luck!",878
9/19/2018 11:49:41,"One of the strategies I found helpful was combining two of the same tool I had already created, as this often led to the creation of more tools. However, I found that as the game progressed this worked less frequently for me. I would recommend trying to combine different tools as well. I was not able to do much with the wood I created as a tool, but I expect that will become a large part of the game as you will need to build bigger pieces for the totem. If you are not able to find a new combination, just continue to put pieces together in various ways. There were several times i believed i was stuck, but if you can create one new piece this often leads to the creation of several more if you use that in future combinations. ",881
9/19/2018 11:50:58,"I was trying to establish the different tools necessary. I didn't worry about any of the paint yet since that is at the very end. I don't remember seeing any names for the different tools but there were two arrowhead looking things that i was thinking was going to turn into ax head of something but i was unable to find out how to make that. My thinking at first was bone for a handle and stone for head but I couldn't find a combination that worked so I then moved on to thinking that it could be a wooden handle. That was what I ended with but I never found the right combination. The part that was most confusing was that when you put in the material and that creates something by itself, it doesn't create double or extra when you put another in so it is sensitive in that way.",879
9/19/2018 12:37:46,"I would suggest trying anything with anything, even though it took a lot of time. Also I found that doubling items tending to be helpful in making something new, and then adding the new things to the most recent thing that you made. ",882
9/19/2018 12:40:32,"This is really hard and confusing, but don't get frustrated. It's very similar to the alchemist app if you ever played that on your iPhone/pod/pad as a kid. Think carefully about the two items you add together, a lot of them can continue to be added to create even more new items. Most of the items I discovered were added from two items, even though there are four spaces to combine things. The combinations may only be able to come from two but I wasn't able to figure it out. There needs to be a way to create logs from the large tree. That's the goal and a lot of the tools I found would help in the ""decoration process"" more than the building. Good luck!!",883
9/19/2018 12:40:33,"Make sure to think logically and try to make stronger resources that can carve the wood. Try to work with the metals and other strong objects to try and make a carving tool. The berries will have to be made into paint for the faces on the the totem, so once you make a material that seems like it can be used as a paintbrush, try to use that to make the berries into paste/paint. If you've successfully made a totem already, try and experiment with the wood and metals to see if you can make any other types of wood.",885
9/19/2018 12:40:34,"You got to keep making combos until something works. Make them big because I tried all the all the 1 by 1's. The game is a spoof, so don't get mad or frustrated. Try and do like 3 different items in the box because I couldn't get through all those combos. ",884
9/21/2018 15:39:20,"try one thing first, and then try to combine two same things at once. once you got the new things, you can try to combine the new things with itself, or combine it with other original sources. also, think logically, how you will create the new things, like you cut things with a knife. ",886
9/21/2018 16:20:21,"Try various types of combinations. There may be some resources that are used alone, some with two different resources and some with multiple of the same resources. As you gain more of the stock, include those with your new combinations and try using more than just two combinations as well. ",889
9/21/2018 16:24:37,"A strategy that worked for me sometimes was to create two versions of a new item that I had just discovered and then attempt to combine them together. I couldn't figure out how to do anything with the red and blue items, that may have to be solved later on in the game after the main totem has mostly been constructed. I just clicked and dragged items into the box without really putting much thought into it since I had a very limited amount of items, but I think it is important as you move on to think small and work your way to a bigger item.",888
9/21/2018 16:26:14,"I don't know about you, but some of the pictures of the ""tools"" were kind of difficult to guess it's true utility, in that case, just randomly try combinations (logical ones, they kind of mimic the real world). I am also not very sure if I have all the tools, there is that weird wooden branch with a small hole which honestly I don't know for what it is for, but probably it will work for the dyes. Make assumptions but not too unrealistic ones.",887
9/21/2018 16:26:19,"I found that using combinations of only two items resulted in finding the most new tools. However, I think more advanced tools may require three or more items. Also don't be afraid to try things two items that may not seem like they go together. I found multiple new tools from combining two identical items. Try to use knowledge of primitive tools to create new items, for example, combining a stone with a another stone may create a sharper tool.",890
9/25/2018 16:50:43,At first you will be a little confused as to what is going on but the gist of the game is to just match different tools from the resources pile together and see what you can form. You can also match things you've formed with the resources as well as with one another. You should just try and match as many different combinations as you can till you get new things.,895
9/25/2018 16:51:16,Try as many combinations as you can. Use the tools created and try them with raw ingredients or with each other. Usually try two things at a time and progress. Use a pattern as this will help with discovering more items. ,894
