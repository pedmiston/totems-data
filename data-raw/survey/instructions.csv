Timestamp,Imagine you are passing on the tools that you discovered to another student who has never played this game before. What would you tell them to help them perform better in the game?,Participant ID
9/17/2018 12:34:02,"Make sure that you use the rock as much as possible because it yields the most results. Strategies that worked was when creating a new tool, test that new tool with every other tool or resource because that often created something new. In the end I spent a lot of time trying to create a stump because that is how you build the totem so use the tools and work with the different trees to try and build the stumps.  The most confusing part was initially starting and trying to decide what to test first so don't hesitate, just simply go for it. ",856
9/17/2018 12:34:40,I would tell them to think carefully about the materials and re-read the directions. I would tell them to try different combinations with the sturdy materials and try to make new things out of the trees as well. I found that guessing with the berries did not work and filling out all four spaces also did not work. I found it difficult/ confusing on how to actually build the pole and what to do once I ended up with certain resources. ,854
9/17/2018 12:34:56,"To begin with, use your rocks. Rocks with rocks, rocks with those advanced rocks, advanced rocks with more advanced items and you'll get a lot of combinations. The berries, not much help. Use your rocks the most. It helps if you make doubles of items and then try combining those to make more new items. Find a pattern and stick to it.",855
9/17/2018 12:37:18,"The last item I discovered was the string, I am guessing that some combination of the string with either the wood poles or the block of larger wood will give you a block. A combination of the string with one of the types of arrowhead may give you a new tool but I doubt it as I think I tried most of them. Also I think the berries are used much later in the game as an item you can use to dye the blocks of wood to make more points from the totem pole. One last piece of advice would be to try multiple of a material to see if something is produced. An example would be to try two or three arrowheads together by them self and then adding another material or tool. When you go through a cold patch where you are not making any progress take stop clicking, take your hand off the mouse and take a deep breath. Then try to think of what real life combinations would yield objects you could use.",857
9/18/2018 12:55:36,Keep the things already made in the stock pile and don't delete them because they could help you advance into other things!,871
9/18/2018 12:56:13,"Use common sense to think of combinations, but also throw things together you might not think work. I didn't expect some of the stuff to work and it did.",870
9/18/2018 12:57:47,"Once you have created two or more tools, try combining them to create even more stronger tools. When guessing, be aware that that you can use the same tool multiple times in one combination.",872
9/18/2018 13:04:45,"Keep putting items together. I found it helpful to use new items that I uncovered to create more and more items. Go off of the items you already made. I tried many combinations of two with my existing tools, and started trying groups of three and didn't find success. I got stuck at this point. Putting same items together often creates new tools. Think about what could go together to create a new tool rather than just testing out random combinations. ",873
9/18/2018 16:43:30,"I suggest trying to follow tools all the way to their most ""useful"" form. Meaning, continue to mix the new tool until it looks like something you might actually use for your totem pole. You should try to keep track of what combinations you have already done. So far I have done nothing with the berries, so I would assume those will come into play later.",874
9/18/2018 16:45:53,Use small tools to make bigger ones,875
9/18/2018 16:49:40,"I started out super slow because I had just randomly started putting the items in the workshop box hoping to find something that worked. A little ways in, I found that it would be more logical to think about a) how the items related to each other and b) how to rotate items in the workshop box so that I could keep track of what I had tried and approach the game more methodically. If I would have had more time, I would have paid more attention to what stayed when I was able to make a tool and what resource transformed into the new resource. Either way, don't get too flustered, just take a step back and think about the end goal (building the totem pole thingy) and what kind of big picture process might need to be done to get there. Also, don't start pressing keys, clicking random buttons, or checking if the computer is a touch screen - think within the game itself. Good luck!",876
9/18/2018 16:50:15,"Guess and check is the most important part. Use common sense when making guesses. Think about the real world and what can be made from natural resources. Always have  the tools you unlock at your disposal in the stock area, and do not keep many or even any of the unlimited resources within the stock area. Do not get frustrated either, it will only be harder.  ",877
9/19/2018 11:44:48,"This game was at first very confusing to me. I did not understand the premise but thought I just should try to continue doing different combinations. I kept doing them & doing them & nothing really worked. I only got a few combinations that were somewhat decent. Still, there was no specific pattern (as though it seemed) when doing it. I never really understood the intent on what to do & didn't get how you made the totem, but I only really got three combinations. So my advice is to experiment and pick up rhythms to find a consistent schedule so you just don't keep redoing certain potential combos because that is the part that got me confused the most. ",880
9/19/2018 11:49:01,"In order to succeed in this game, you need to use logic. Some tools, such as the tool I created, was made by a rope, a stick, and a rock. These three things logically go together to make such a tool. This tool was then used to chop down a tree. Thinking logically like this will make the game much easier. Also, keep experimenting the new things you acquire with the old to create something new. A strategy that worked for me when I was stumped was to match two of the same things together. Perhaps this strategy only works in the preliminary rounds, but it worked for me. A final tip is to keep trying things CONSTANTLY. I did things I thought I did before but since i was constantly trying things, I would make something new. Keep these things in mind and build a great totem pole! Good Luck!",878
9/19/2018 11:49:41,"One of the strategies I found helpful was combining two of the same tool I had already created, as this often led to the creation of more tools. However, I found that as the game progressed this worked less frequently for me. I would recommend trying to combine different tools as well. I was not able to do much with the wood I created as a tool, but I expect that will become a large part of the game as you will need to build bigger pieces for the totem. If you are not able to find a new combination, just continue to put pieces together in various ways. There were several times i believed i was stuck, but if you can create one new piece this often leads to the creation of several more if you use that in future combinations. ",881
9/19/2018 11:50:58,"I was trying to establish the different tools necessary. I didn't worry about any of the paint yet since that is at the very end. I don't remember seeing any names for the different tools but there were two arrowhead looking things that i was thinking was going to turn into ax head of something but i was unable to find out how to make that. My thinking at first was bone for a handle and stone for head but I couldn't find a combination that worked so I then moved on to thinking that it could be a wooden handle. That was what I ended with but I never found the right combination. The part that was most confusing was that when you put in the material and that creates something by itself, it doesn't create double or extra when you put another in so it is sensitive in that way.",879
9/19/2018 12:37:46,"I would suggest trying anything with anything, even though it took a lot of time. Also I found that doubling items tending to be helpful in making something new, and then adding the new things to the most recent thing that you made. ",882
9/19/2018 12:40:32,"This is really hard and confusing, but don't get frustrated. It's very similar to the alchemist app if you ever played that on your iPhone/pod/pad as a kid. Think carefully about the two items you add together, a lot of them can continue to be added to create even more new items. Most of the items I discovered were added from two items, even though there are four spaces to combine things. The combinations may only be able to come from two but I wasn't able to figure it out. There needs to be a way to create logs from the large tree. That's the goal and a lot of the tools I found would help in the ""decoration process"" more than the building. Good luck!!",883
9/19/2018 12:40:33,"Make sure to think logically and try to make stronger resources that can carve the wood. Try to work with the metals and other strong objects to try and make a carving tool. The berries will have to be made into paint for the faces on the the totem, so once you make a material that seems like it can be used as a paintbrush, try to use that to make the berries into paste/paint. If you've successfully made a totem already, try and experiment with the wood and metals to see if you can make any other types of wood.",885
9/19/2018 12:40:34,"You got to keep making combos until something works. Make them big because I tried all the all the 1 by 1's. The game is a spoof, so don't get mad or frustrated. Try and do like 3 different items in the box because I couldn't get through all those combos. ",884
9/21/2018 15:39:20,"try one thing first, and then try to combine two same things at once. once you got the new things, you can try to combine the new things with itself, or combine it with other original sources. also, think logically, how you will create the new things, like you cut things with a knife. ",888
9/21/2018 16:20:21,"Try various types of combinations. There may be some resources that are used alone, some with two different resources and some with multiple of the same resources. As you gain more of the stock, include those with your new combinations and try using more than just two combinations as well. ",889
9/21/2018 16:24:37,"A strategy that worked for me sometimes was to create two versions of a new item that I had just discovered and then attempt to combine them together. I couldn't figure out how to do anything with the red and blue items, that may have to be solved later on in the game after the main totem has mostly been constructed. I just clicked and dragged items into the box without really putting much thought into it since I had a very limited amount of items, but I think it is important as you move on to think small and work your way to a bigger item.",890
9/21/2018 16:26:14,"I don't know about you, but some of the pictures of the ""tools"" were kind of difficult to guess it's true utility, in that case, just randomly try combinations (logical ones, they kind of mimic the real world). I am also not very sure if I have all the tools, there is that weird wooden branch with a small hole which honestly I don't know for what it is for, but probably it will work for the dyes. Make assumptions but not too unrealistic ones.",891
9/21/2018 16:26:19,"I found that using combinations of only two items resulted in finding the most new tools. However, I think more advanced tools may require three or more items. Also don't be afraid to try things two items that may not seem like they go together. I found multiple new tools from combining two identical items. Try to use knowledge of primitive tools to create new items, for example, combining a stone with a another stone may create a sharper tool.",892
9/25/2018 16:50:43,At first you will be a little confused as to what is going on but the gist of the game is to just match different tools from the resources pile together and see what you can form. You can also match things you've formed with the resources as well as with one another. You should just try and match as many different combinations as you can till you get new things.,895
9/25/2018 16:51:16,Try as many combinations as you can. Use the tools created and try them with raw ingredients or with each other. Usually try two things at a time and progress. Use a pattern as this will help with discovering more items. ,894
9/26/2018 16:08:47,you can use the same tool multiple times in one combination.  Other than that I just guessed random combinations.  Combining already made tools can make them stronger.  start with the small green tree in the first box.,897
9/26/2018 16:08:51,"Look at the tab on the left hand side that says resources. Someone who  has previously done this game has already made tools. Look at that first and if you click on the tools it will tell you how to build them. I used for example the skinny tree to make the tree branch and then after that you want to drag that item into the top right box to make a collection of resources. After you make all the rocks and branches and stuff, keep trying to make a totem. Put multiple tools together at once to make something. I think the red and blue berries are used at the end to decorate the totem to make more points but i don't know for sure. You might get really frustrated or tired so just read this over and take a breath. The last item i found was the string and I couldn't move past it. Just do the best you can this game is super hard.",898
9/26/2018 16:09:36,"First off placing an item by itself is the best way to start the game. Once you've got a number of tools by just placing one item, begin to move onto placing two items into the workshop. A pattern will begin and you will see the the formation of the tools begin to progress towards building the totem. After getting to the axe, begin to think about how to carve tools with it from the big and little tree and the branches. The axe is a vital part of building the totem. Try to be quick and methodical with your decisions along with keeping you inventory full of the tools you've made and don't discard of them until you've used them to make the next tool.",899
9/26/2018 16:14:30,Just put yourself in that setting and think how you gonna build a pole by yourself. Do not forget to access the record to see what have been made.  Think in the real life how you paint a piece of wood and do your best to try any possible combinations. Do not be upset if you fail a lot! ,896
10/2/2018 13:01:11,"I would tell them that you can use the item that you produced and store it in the ""stock"". It took me a while to understand that, but once I did, it was much easier. At first I just made the first three items, but then I found out how to make the more complex ones.",901
10/2/2018 13:02:46,"Before you start thinking about building the actual totem pole, make sure you look at the left and hand side and see the tools that can be built. Click on the very first tool, and create it, and continue doing so until you have made all the tools. The tool combinations all require only two different things. Create a few of each kind of tool and store it in the boxes. From there on I'm not sure what to do because I never got to building the actual totem pole. ",900
10/2/2018 13:04:44,"try different combinations and make multiple of stocks of same stuff and combine them together
and if have the chance please ask the difference between 3 type of rocks because it makes no sense to me!!!!",903
10/2/2018 13:05:54,"Think of any different type of combinations. Continue to try all sorts of combos, whether they are from the beginning resources or the resources created from the basic resources. Try to think which resources would be more helpful compared to all the resources given. Also, try combos of more than just two. I didn't find any combos of more than two resources, but there is still the possibility. And lastly, continue to guess, even when you are out of options. There may be secret combos that may work.",902
10/2/2018 13:47:34,I found that using the guide seemed to be helpful. Trying different 2 combination methods out of the guide didn't help. Putting two of the same items together also didn't help. I did not manage to discover any item that could be formed from 3 items. I found the game confusing since I did not understand how I could make a totem pole. I tried putting 2 half logs together with twine but I still couldn't manage to make a log. Good luck.,907
10/2/2018 13:47:56,"This game can get discouraging but never give up. Try combinations of items solo or double. Also use logic to build items like rope, a stick, and rock to create a knife-like thing. Using stone heads to smooth or cut the wood will get you bonus points. Stack your totem when you can right away to gain extra points. Always keep difficult to make items in your stockpile to speed up production of potential new items.",904
10/2/2018 13:49:23,"When you first start the game, click on the record button towards the top left of the screen and click on all of the objects that I made, so then you can create them quickly and start trying to work on new objects. In the game, I found that I was only making objects with one or two elements, but towards the end I started doing combinations of three. I didn't find any with three, but maybe you will. Also, i wouldn't worry about the paint yet because that is at the end and it takes a lot of time to work with the paint elements, so try building tools first. Also, make sure that you drag your items that you created into the stock area for future use, so then it is easy to retrieve them later on in the game. Try as many combinations as possible and best of luck to you!",905
10/2/2018 13:49:47,"Start off by looking through the combinations that have already been made. I found it helpful to review these combinations and see what each part is made of. During the game this ended up helping me out. Further, don't get frustrated. I feel as if I wasted way to much time trying the same thing over and over again - don't do that. Lastly, think somewhat logically. The combinations kind of make sense once you're done. Good luck.",906
10/2/2018 16:58:06,"Look at the ""record"" section right away. This will give away the basic combos you need to know to make new tools out of the ones you have. From there, start making combos out of 2 of the same resources. After that, just making random combos and hope for the best! Don't get frustrated if you end up not building a totem pole because I couldn't either! Just have fun and get creative.",908
10/2/2018 16:59:00,"Don't stress about finding combinations for tools. Take what you have and start out simple first. Then take the new tools you make and try to break those down even more. It may seem frustrating and time consuming, and you may not figure out how to make the totem pole but try your hardest until the time is up.",910
10/2/2018 16:59:27,"If you're playing this game, it's all about guessing and checking. I tried so many different combinations throughout the game, and eventually you will find something that will help you in getting something else. I would also recommend trying to submit one resource at a time to try and get the smaller tools first. At first, I was trying a bunch of long combinations of resources, only to find later that the smaller you start, the easier it is to find tools. ",909
10/5/2018 13:40:38,Try lots of different combinations. use multiple of one tool or resource in a combination. Keep a closer track of what you have tried so you don't try the same combinations. I am not sure the berries will be useful until you have to paint. It is quite difficult. Have fun!,911
10/5/2018 13:41:57,"At the beginning I tried to put the same items in the workshop just with different amount of it. It worked, once or twice, but it took a very long time. I think the more effective way is to think what resources can be used together to make tools in real life instead of just guessing on random things.",913
10/5/2018 13:42:55,"The only two resources that can be converted are the big tree and the small tree. Besides those 2 resources, it was very difficult to understand the purpose of the game and how to construct the totem poles. I didn't really get far in this game, but I basically just guessed many different combinations of the resources to see if they would turn into anything. I also clicked on random parts of the screen hoping that some tool guide or another function would pop up and allow me to complete the totem pole. ",912
10/5/2018 14:28:29,"My first piece of advice would be to be patient with this game.  It is very easy to get frustrated and give up, as many of the combinations of tools do not work.  However, keep trying.  Try single tools and try tool combinations with two, three, or four tools.  Create a pattern for your tests so you do not keep repeating combinations- I did not do a good job with this and felt that I wasted a lot of time repeating combinations.  Best of luck!!",916
10/5/2018 14:28:31,"I would tell the participant to read the directions carefully, because I don't think I did that too well. I barely found any combinations that worked, so I would also tell them to relax and just make as many combinations as possible until they are told to stop. The process is frustrating so I'd tell them to relax. I can't give much advice since I didn't exactly understand it myself.",914
10/5/2018 14:28:52,"I found it very difficult to actually create the necessary blocks to build a totem pole. I would recommend trying combinations of wood and stone, as I felt like certain combinations would produce useful tools. Often times the news tools I produced were useful in producing other new tools. I could not determine the significance of the berries, but I felt like they should be used as ink. I think once you produce a wooden block that you can actually use to build a totem pole, then the berries would be useful as ink to possibly create a face of some kind. I did not find any combinations of more than two items, but I think that there are possibly combinations of three or four blocks that would create tools. Lastly, I really had to just play around with it in order to create combinations that actually worked. ",915
10/5/2018 14:31:48,"It's not like the mine craft that you can combine more than two same items together, as least I tried many but failed. But you can combine more than two different things together, just try different combination as long as they have some inner association. And don't forget to use your new created items with the original ones, it would be helpful.",917
